# Obesity Level Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project builds a machine learning model to **predict the obesity level of individuals** based on lifestyle, dietary habits, and health-related attributes. The workflow includes data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, feature encoding, model training with ensemble methods, and evaluation using multiple performance metrics.
